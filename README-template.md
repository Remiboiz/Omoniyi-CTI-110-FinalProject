## Overview - For this Project i built a recipe page using HTML and CSS. The goal was to make the layout clean readable, and close to the example design that was given to us.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox or other browser to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I started by looking at the design example and figuring out how the page should be laid out 
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Basic responsive layout

### What I learned

While working on the project, i learned how important structure and spacing are when building a webpage. Writing the HTML first lowkey made it easy to style everything later with CSS.I also learned how small charges like padding, margins and font colors

I got more comfortable using containers, styling lists and tables and matching my page to a design example.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
